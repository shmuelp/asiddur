Installation instructions are very device-specific.  Therefore, take a look at the instructions below.


# Web/OTA (Over-the-Air) #
On a device with a network connection (e.g. a PDA with wireless or a cell phone with a data plan), the easiest way to install ASiddur is to simply browse to the correct URL to the JAD file (_**TODO: Fill in URL**_), and let the device do the rest.

# Infrared / Bluetooth #
On a device with infrared or Bluetooth, you can download the the JAR file, and beam/send it to the device

# Cable #
This method is entirely manufacturer-specific.  You will typically need a data/sync cable for your device, and software provided by the manufacturer to send ASiddur to your device.
