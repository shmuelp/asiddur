ASiddur will be capable of showing the appropriate tefillah for a given time and place.  It will run on any J2ME-compliant device, including many cell phones and PDAs.

It is  currently usable as a siddur (no intelligence yet) on many devices.  Note that full capabilities are not planned until version 1.0.  For bug reports and current status, please see the issue tracker.

Utilities such as a luach (Jewish calendar), text drawing, etc are kept as common as possible, within performance demands.Development blog:

There is a [live emulated version](http://apps.facebook.com/javamobile/link.php?app=27) available on Facebook.  Note that the controls on it are generally more cumbersome than on a real phone.

Stable version installation:
