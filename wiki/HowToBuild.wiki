= Introduction =

This pages describes how to build from sources.  The current directions assume Linux, although the steps should be similar (identical?) on other platforms.  They also assume development on the trunk.

  # Check out the project:
    {{{svn checkout http://asiddur.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ asiddur}}}
  # Download and install [http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/index.php NetBeans] (5.0 is currently used, 5.5 works as well).  Download the bundle with an included JDK if you don't already have one installed.
  # Download and install the [http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/index.php?rs=11&p=4 NetBeans Mobility Pack].
  # Open NetBeans, and choose File | Open Project...
    * The project directory is the {{{asiddur}}} subdirectory of the directory to which you downloaded the source in step #1 above. 
  # Also open the project based in the {{{common/ASiddurCommon}}}
    * To work on the desktop program that converts an XML-based tefilla into a binary image, also open and build the {{{tools/text-converter/TefillaConverter}}} project.
  # Build each project.  Build {{{ASiddurCommon}}} first.  You may need to replace any text in the project files that contains {{{/home/shmuelp/Projects/}}} with the directory you are working  in.  I don't know how to abstract that out of the project files, but I haven't tried all that hard.
    * The resulting JAR and JAD files are in the {{{dist/}}} subdirectory.
